# About

This is my second project in react. It is a guided project offered under the Scrimba developer path.

The first guided project can be found here - https://github.com/prashantbhudwal/proj__reactInfoSite-guided

The objective in this project is to solidify react basics and to use react to build a very basic dynamic page.

# Learning Objectives

- Make reusable component with props.
- Map data to components.

# Design

# Hypothesis

On the first glance, the project seems to have 3 main components.

- Header
- Hero Component
- Experience List

I think Experience list could be further broken down into

- Card Component

The design does not seem to have a footer, and I think making that would be a nice TODO.

# Results

TBD.
